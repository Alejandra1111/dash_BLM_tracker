# BLM Tracker (Python Dash App)

This repository contains source code for a web application of **Twitter** data gathering, storage, and analysis on hashtag **BlackLivesMatter**. It is powered by **Twitter API**, **AWS Kinesis**, **Python**, and **Dash**.
 
Users of this app can **browse through BLM statistics** for **selected city and time** to observe **trends in sentiments and emotions** and discover **top tweets and influencers**. One can also apply **a keyword filter** to narrow the focus.   

Currently live app is hosted in [an AWS EC2 micro instance](http://18.223.131.215:8050/). The app's response speed is much slow in this low-key EC2 instance compared to running the app in laptop.   


## Current Project Status 

The app currently mostly uses **the data collected during the development stage**. There have been some disruptions in the data collection process, so **the data are quite incomplete for some dates and hours.**  

More complete data can be incorporated once the data archives are collected and organized (work in progress).
